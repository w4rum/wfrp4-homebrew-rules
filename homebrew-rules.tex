This is a set of homebrew rules and interpretations of ambiguous statements
from the official material for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition.

This document's structure is aimed at preserving the structure of the Core
Rulebook and thus roughly reflects the position of the mentioned mechanics in
the Core Rulebook.

While this document is obviously based on work from Games Workshop and Cubile
7, it is merely meant to provide clarity to our local group and other fans.

\subsection{Career Trappings}
You do not need the trappings of a career level that you wish to switch to.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Skills and Talents}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Grouped Skills and Specialisation}
When buying Advances in a grouped skill, you \textit{must} choose a
specialization.
Improving, for example, your general Stealth skill is not possible.
You may, however, improve specializations such as Stealth (Urban).

When a grouped skill is also a basic skill, you are assumed to be proficient
enough in all of its specializations to be allowed to roll on them.
An exception to this rule is the \textbf{Melee} skill.
As stated in the Consumer's Guide in the Core Rulebook, you may only use a
specialization of the Melee skill in which you have at least one Advance.

As will all other skills, acquiring an Advance in a specialization requires
either having the specialization as a career skill or making a
\textit{Training} Endeavour.

\subsection{Talent Advances}
As mentioned in the Core Rulebook, some talents may be obtained multiple times,
up to a maximum based on a certain Characteristic Bonus.
This maximum is only enforced when trying to buy a Talent.
If, for whatever reason, the maximum drops below the number of times that you
have already taken the Talent, you keep all of the Advances but may not buy
another Advance in that Talent until you've increased your maximum again.

\subsection{Bleeding Condition}
In addition to Heal Tests, spells, and prayers, you may make a
\textbf{Challenging Dexterity Test (+0)} as your Action to remove one
\textit{Bleeding} Condition if you use a bandage.
The bandage is only consumed on success, as failure is noticed immediately,
allowing you to try reapplying the same bandage next round.

You may apply multiple bandages to the same wound.

When using spells or prayers that heal wounds, remove one \textit{Bleeding}
Condition per wound healed \textit{instead} of healing wounds, leaving the
patient's amount of remaining wounds unchanged.
If your spell or prayer heals more wounds than there are \textit{Bleeding}
Conditions, the patient only recovers the excess amount of
wounds healed.

\subsection{Stunned Condition}
When attempting to remove a \textit{Stunned} condition with an
\textbf{Endurance Test}, ignore all penalties inflicted by the \textit{Stunned}
conditions themselves.

E.g. a character with Endurance on 40 and 3 active \textit{Stunned} Conditions
would still roll on \textbf{Endurance (40)}.
Modifiers from all other sources still apply.

\subsection{Critical Wounds}
When taking a Critical Wound due to losing more Wounds than available, the
difference is treated as \enquote{excess damage}.

When determining the severity of the Critical Wound, add this modifier after
rolling 1d100:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $\text{excess damage} < \text{Toughness Bonus}$: -20
    \item If $\text{excess damage} \in [\text{TB}, 2*\text{TB}]$: +0
    \item If $\text{excess damage} > 2* \text{Toughness Bonus}$: +20
\end{itemize}

The first case mentioned here is already included in the Core Rulebook.
The version here does not \enquote{stack} with the original one.

After sustaining a Critical Wound in this manner, the character's wounds are
set to 0, applying the \textit{Prone} Condition as mentioned in the CRB.

All items here are either additions or modifications of already existing ones.
Whenever there is a name conflict, the homebrew rules take precedent.
